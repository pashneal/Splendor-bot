## Running a Tournament 

To run a tournament is simple, navigate to the `splendor-tournament/scaffolding` directory and execute 

```
python3 run_game.py
```

in your terminal
(Note: the first build can take 3-5 minutes! It should be faster on subsequent builds) 

If all goes well, you should be able to go [here](http://localhost:3030/splendor/splendor_4pl.html) and see the game that the server just played for you.
